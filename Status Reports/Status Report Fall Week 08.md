## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
This week, we did heavy research on the types of attacks that could potentially affect our results of our program. We conducted extensive research on various attacks that could compromise the accuracy of our program. We also explored potential defenses to make our detection model more robust. These findings will help us improve the reliability of our results.

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
We want to achieve a high detection rate of AI-written text, so we thoroughly analyzed specific algorithmic vulnerabilities and implemented advanced techniques to mitigate false positives. Our approach combined rigorous research with targeted programming to refine detection mechanisms and optimize their accuracy.

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
Same issue as last week where at this point we are trying to make sure we get a fully written and tested prototype for the fall end date.
