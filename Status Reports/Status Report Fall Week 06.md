## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
This week, we successfully developed the watermark detection algorithm and integrated it with the embedding process, achieving a functional end-to-end system capable of embedding and detecting watermarks within large language models. We conducted extensive tests using diverse datasets to evaluate the system's performance, robustness, and reliability. Additionally, we began optimizing algorithms for better efficiency and reduced computational overhead. Technical documentation, including user guides and system architecture descriptions, is in progress.

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
Next week, we will investigate methods to improve watermark resilience against text paraphrasing and editing. We will further optimize the system for scalability and efficiency, potentially leveraging parallel processing techniques. We plan to perform stress tests to evaluate system performance under various load conditions. Additionally, we will prepare a progress presentation for feedback from our mentor and faculty advisor.

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
We discovered that the watermark's detectability decreases significantly when the text is heavily paraphrased. We need to enhance the algorithm to address this vulnerability. The current implementation faces challenges with scalability due to high computational demands. We are exploring optimization techniques and more efficient algorithms. Computational resource constraints continue to slow down testing phases; we are looking into accessing additional resources or optimizing code for better performance. No other significant concerns at this time.
