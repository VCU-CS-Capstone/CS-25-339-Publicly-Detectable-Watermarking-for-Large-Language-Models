## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
Conducted extensive research on the types of attacks that could potentially affect our programâ€™s results. Investigated various attack vectors that might compromise the accuracy of our detection model. Explored potential defenses and techniques aimed at bolstering the robustness of our watermark detection. Compiled research findings to guide further development of our model and improve overall reliability.
 
## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
Focus on achieving a high detection rate for AI-written text by analyzing algorithmic vulnerabilities in depth. Begin implementing advanced techniques to mitigate false positives in our detection model. Integrate research insights with targeted programming efforts to refine our detection mechanisms and optimize their accuracy. Develop a preliminary prototype outline to ensure we are on track for a fully written and tested version by the fall end date. 

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
We continue to face challenges in ensuring that our prototype is fully written, rigorously tested, and meets the planned quality standards for the fall deadline. As we balance extensive research with prototype development, prioritizing tasks effectively remains critical.
