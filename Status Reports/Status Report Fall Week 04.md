## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
This week, we focused on evaluating and testing various software tools and platforms to determine the most suitable options for our project. We finalized the selection of key tools and began setting up the environment for implementation. Additionally, we outline detailed task assignments to ensure all team members are clear on their roles and responsibilities moving forward.

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
Next week, we will integrate the selected tools into our workflow and start implementing the core functionalities of the system. Emphasis will be placed on testing early integrations to identifiy and resolve poential compatibility issues. We also plan to review progress and make adjustments as needed. 

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
One challenge this week was ensuring compatibility between some of the shortlisted tools, which required additonal time and research. While we managed to address these issues, it highlighted the need for more robust testing during the selection process. No other significant concerns at this time.
