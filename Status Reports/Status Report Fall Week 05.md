## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
This week, we integrated the selected tools into our workflow and started implementing the core functionalities of the system. We focused on developing the watermark embedding algorithm and created an initial prototype. Preliminary tests were conducted to assess its effectiveness. Additionally, we held regular team meetings to ensure all team members are aligned on project goals and responsibilities.

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
Next week, we will refine the embedding algorithm based on initial test feedback to enhance the watermark's robustness. We will begin implementing the watermark detection mechanism and integrate it with the embedding process. Emphasis will be placed on testing early integrations to identify and resolve potential compatibility issues. We also plan to start drafting technical documentation to support ongoing development and future collaboration.

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
We encountered compatibility challenges with some libraries when handling large datasets required for training, which demanded additional time and research. While we managed to address these issues, it highlighted the need for more robust testing during the selection process. Limited computational resources are affecting the speed of testing and development; we are considering the use of cloud-based solutions to mitigate this. No other significant concerns at this time.
