Week 2 Status Report

This week's achievements:

- Research on Possible Attacks: We did a thorough study on the different ways our watermarking system might be attacked to ensure it stays secure and reliable.
- Analysis of Attack Paths: We looked into specific ways these attacks could happen and how they might mess up our watermark detection.
- Exploring Protective Methods: We checked out various methods to make our watermark detection stronger and more foolproof.
- Summary of Research: We gathered all our research into one detailed report to help us improve and make our watermark detection more trustworthy.

Goals for next week:

- Checking for Weak Spots in Algorithms: We'll examine our algorithms closely to make sure they can reliably spot AI-generated text, which is key for the effectiveness of our watermarking.
- Starting Advanced Methods: We'll begin using sophisticated techniques to lessen the chances of mistakenly identifying something as AI-generated when it's not.
- Using Our Research in Our Work: We'll use what we've learned from our research to make our detection methods better and more precise.
- Building a Basic Model: We'll start sketching out a basic version of our project to make sure we're on the right track for completing a fully working version by the end of the project in the fall.

Current challenges and concerns:

- Difficulties with the Prototype: We're still facing issues in making sure our prototype meets high standards and is thoroughly tested by the fall deadline.
- Juggling Research and Development: It's tough to manage both in-depth research and the actual building of the prototype. We need to get better at prioritizing tasks and managing our resources effectively.
