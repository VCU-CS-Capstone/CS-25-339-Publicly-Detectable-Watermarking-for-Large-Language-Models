# Status Reports Folder
Weekly status reports go into this folder

This Readme.md serves as the front page of this folder - update the table with very succinct weekly reports.

Project Plan.md is a document that should be updated accordingly as the project develops through the year.

Status Report Fall Week XX.md is a template for to copy-paste into new Status reports you generate every week.

## Fall Semester

| Document | Tasks | Accomplishments | Issues |
|---|---|---|---|
| Week 1 Status Report | We successfully selected and secured the necessary databases for the project after comparing several options based on performance, scalability, and cost. Detailed flowcharts were created to map out the entire system architecture and user flow, ensuring clarity and alignment among all team members. | Next week, we plan to begin the initial phase of coding. We aim to implement the basic framework and start integrating the database. Debugging will be crucial to ensure the foundation is robust and scalable. | No significant problems to report this week. All team members are aligned and enthusiastic about the project's direction.|
| Week 2 Status Report | This week we initiated extensive online research to understand current trends and best practices in database integration and user interface design. This research is crucial to ensure that our project is built on robust and modern standards. We also began preliminary coding based on our findings and the flowcharts developed in Week 1. | In the coming week, we will continue our research, particularly focusing on advanced database features and security measures. The coding will proceed alongside, with a focus on integrating sophisticated database functionalities. |the high costs associated with premium database features are a potential budgetary constraint. We are exploring alternative solutions and additional funding avenues. |
| Week 3 Status Report | This week, our group met to make sure we understood what we are all doing and made sure we all understand what we need to accomplish. Continued heavy research which will help us in the long run as we may need to deep diver into harder topics later on. | In the coming week, we need to start finding out what softwares and tools. There are lots of tools that could be useful and we want to make sure we pick the correct ones. | No concerns as of this point. | 
| Week 4 Status Report | This week we did research on watermarking in general as well as with the use of AI. |Next week we will start to use dedicated software to implement watermarking on prototype models. | No issues to report. |
| Week 5 Status Report | Integrated selected tools into workflow; started implementing core functionalities; developed watermark embedding algorithm and initial prototype; conducted preliminary tests; held team meetings to ensure alignment. | Next week, we plan to refine the embedding algorithm based on initial test feedback to enhance robustness; begin implementing the watermark detection mechanism and integrate it with the embedding process; start drafting technical documentation.	 | No concerns as of this point. |
| Week 6 Status Report |Developed the watermark detection algorithm and integrated it with the embedding process; achieved a functional end-to-end system; conducted extensive tests; began optimizing algorithms; continued technical documentation. | Next week, we plan to improve watermark resilience against paraphrasing; further optimize the system for scalability and efficiency; perform stress tests; prepare a progress presentation.	 | No concerns as of this point. |
| Week 7 Status Report | This week, we continued research on how to improve watermark resilience against test paraphrasing and editing. Our goal is to further optimize the system for scalability and efficiency, potentially leveraging parallet processing techniques. We also looked at user guides to make it easier for new users to use the program. | Next week, we will continue doing heavy research and programming. We want to find out specific attacks on these algorithms as well as different types of techniques for figuring out false positives. Our main goal at the end of this project is to get a high detection rate of AI written text. | Our only issue at this point is trying to make sure we get a fully written and tested prototype for the fall end date. |
| Week 8 Status Report | This week, we did heavy research on the types of attacks that could potentially affect our results of our program. We conducted extensive research on various attacks that could compromise the accuracy of our program. We also explored potential defenses to make our detection model more robust. These findings will help us improve the reliability of our results. | We want to achieve a high detection rate of AI-written text, so we thoroughly analyzed specific algorithmic vulnerabilities and implemented advanced techniques to mitigate false positives. Our approach combined rigorous research with targeted programming to refine detection mechanisms and optimize their accuracy. | Same issue as last week where at this point we are trying to make sure we get a fully written and tested prototype for the fall end date. |
