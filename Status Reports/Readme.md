## Fall Semester

| Document | Tasks | Accomplishments | Issues |
|---|---|---|---|
| Week 1 Status Report | We successfully selected and secured the necessary databases for the project after comparing several options based on performance, scalability, and cost. Detailed flowcharts were created to map out the entire system architecture and user flow, ensuring clarity and alignment among all team members. | Next week, we plan to begin the initial phase of coding. We aim to implement the basic framework and start integrating the database. Debugging will be crucial to ensure the foundation is robust and scalable. | No significant problems to report this week. All team members are aligned and enthusiastic about the project's direction.|
| Week 2 Status Report | This week we initiated extensive online research to understand current trends and best practices in database integration and user interface design. This research is crucial to ensure that our project is built on robust and modern standards. We also began preliminary coding based on our findings and the flowcharts developed in Week 1. | In the coming week, we will continue our research, particularly focusing on advanced database features and security measures. The coding will proceed alongside, with a focus on integrating sophisticated database functionalities. | We are concerned about Neil's need to quickly learn Java to contribute effectively to the project. Additionally, the high costs associated with premium database features are a potential budgetary constraint. We are exploring alternative solutions and additional funding avenues. |
